# HTML & CSS Landing Page Project

*A simple static landing page built with HTML and CSS.*

## 🔍 Features
**Basic Layout**: Hero section with heading, subheading, and button.
- **Future Improvements**: 
  - Better responsiveness with media queries (currently optimized for desktop).
  - Better design (currently limited due to the requirements of my 1st project)
  - Semantic HTML5 tags such as `<header>`, `<section>`, etc. (currently uses `<div>`-based structure).
  - Add CSS3 features (variables, transitions)
- **CSS Styling**: Custom fonts, colors, and basic hover effects.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **HTML** (Transitional/Non-semantic): Classic HTML structure.
- **CSS**: Basic styling without CSS3 variables or advanced features.
